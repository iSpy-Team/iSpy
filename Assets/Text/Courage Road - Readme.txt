This font is a new entry into one of my most popular forms, the stressed poster font. This one is extra bold, though, because it's about one person's courage, and a tribute to the line to their heart. This is the COURAGE ROAD.

PLEASE CONSIDER HELPING: Paula Repko, who inspired this font, needs your help. Visit paula.cumberlandgames.com

COURAGE ROAD is a full US-Keyboard Small-Caps stressed poster font with some extras for additional European alphabets. Enjoy!
